# EXPLODING DECK

(Test it out here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nmv_test/)

### Inspiration
Since I was a little kid, I have played this game with my friends, using the standard 52-card deck. When I received an email about this hackathon, I was wondering which project I should do, and this game came to my mind. However, using the standard deck is too boring and Reddit is not a place for boring stuff. Therefore, I added multiple special and boom cards to make the game more engaging and fun.

### What it does
This is a multiplayer game with unlimited players. The rule is really simple: If you draw the card with the same color as the previous one, then you explode and lose the points. There are also some special cards with detailed functions described in the app that you can view with a simple button. The game is updated daily and there is also a leaderboard that also updated daily, so users can compete everyday without boredom.

### How I built it
I used TypeScript and JavaScript for this project. I also used Github to store all the versions of the game, so other people can see the game updated throughout each version. This game was developed all by Devvit - a tool for Reddit Developers with tons of functions like Redis, Realtime, and Reddit API. It also has a Devvit AI, which is really helpful and can answer almost every question that I have.

### Challenges I ran into
Coming to this Hackathon with no prior knowledge about TypeScript, I was nervous because most of the time, I coded in Python, so doing an entirely new app with another language made me sweat. Since the language and functions are new to me, I need to learn from the start. Luckily, with the support from the Devvit page, Devvit Discord, and also Devvit AI, I finished my app on time.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
First of all, I did not give up in the middle after a lot of failures. I want to finish my game and share it with other Reddit users to try and have fun. Not only that, I created a new game from scratch without any prior knowledge, and I am really proud of myself after finishing it. Finally, I have learned a lot after this Hackathon, and it brought many new knowledge to me.

### What I learned
I have learned how to code in TypeScript, how to do time management, and also how to not give up after failures.

### What's next for Exploding Deck
Exploding Deck is now completed and all the functions work well. However, I want to optimize it further so it can run without any delay (although delay does not appear too many times). Not only that, I want to add more special cards to make the game more fun.
